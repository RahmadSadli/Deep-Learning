I finally made this program simple and readable
Hopefully, this program will help some beginners like me to understand better object detection.
If you want to redistribute it, just keep the author's name.

In oder to execute this program, you need to install TensorFlow 2.0 and opencv 4.x

For more details about how this program works. I explained well about it, just click on the link below:

Credit to:
Ayoosh Kathuria who shared his great work using pytorch, really appreaciated it.
